# AI_Game
 
Hide and Seek Home is a Unity 3D stealth horror game where the player needs to escape from an AI. 
- The AI enemy wanders around the escape gates and chases you once you are within his angle and distance of vision. 
- While trying to escape, you can hide or lock yourself in coffins that are placed around. 
- You might also step on noisy branches that will get the enemyâ€™s attention or scream in order to lure him to the wrong direction. 
- You cannot win by making it to the gates while being chased. You need to reach the gates unnoticed.

This game is my first attempt at learning Unity 3D.
